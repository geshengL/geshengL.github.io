# 🧑‍🎓 About Me
+ I am a undergraduate student majoring in electronic science and technology at the Beijing University of Technology.
+ My research interest includes *Analog Integrated Circuit design, Application Research Based on FPGA and machine learning*.
+ An article about machine learning I have published have been included by in **IEEE**. And a paper about **CMOS-ISFET-based pH detection circuit for body fluids** is being submitted. Now, my classmates and I are studying **Design of Identity Detection System Based on FPGA**, which is expected to be published in a few months.
