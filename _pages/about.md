- Divide the transmission stages of different viruses(SARS-CoV-2,Alpha,Delta,Omicron), calculate the transmission rate and duration.
- Take some cities as examples to study the transmission rate and duration.
- Compare the effects of temperature, dew point and humidity on virus transmission.
- Predict the characteristics and duration of Omicron.
